# OFPPT End-of-study Project(co-voyage)
## Introduction
As part of our final year project, we studied the implementation of a Co-voyage platform. Inspired by the increasing popularity of social services in recent years, especially through platforms such as AirBnB, Blablacar, or Couchsurfing, which are based on the principles of community life and mutual assistance, we propose a platform that will allow users to share rides and trips.

This platform will foster human interactions by offering people the opportunity to share pleasant moments during their travels and create memorable memories. It will also help reduce the stress and loneliness experienced during long journeys.

Our goal is to develop a user-friendly and secure interface, offering users the possibility to easily find travel companions for their trips.

## DÃ©roulement
Here we expose the stages and objectives of this project, namely the creation of a website allowing users to indicate and book journeys. We also detail the scope of the project, the stakeholders involved, and the established deadlines.

### Needs Analysis
A thorough analysis of user needs as well as functional and non-functional requirements of the carpooling site was conducted. This step allowed us to define the main features, such as availability search, real-time booking, etc.
### System Design
We developed a detailed technical architecture for the deco-voyage site, focusing on security, scalability, and user-friendliness. Mock-ups and prototypes were also created to visualize the user interface.
### Development and Testing
This section presents the various phases of project development, using best practices in software development. Rigorous testing was conducted to ensure the stability, performance, and quality of the co-voyage site.
### Deployment
We detail the steps for deploying the co-voyage site, including server configuration, integration with third-party systems, and final testing before making it available to end users.
### Results and Achievements
We evaluate the results obtained at the end of the project, highlighting key features successfully implemented, issues encountered, and solutions adopted. Positive feedback from users(our supervisors) during beta testing is also presented.
